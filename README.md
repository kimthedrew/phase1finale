# description
This is a site for ordering shoes online.
the site has a search bar for searching what type of shoe you want and when you key in, if the shoe is available it is filtered to the one keyed in and if it's not available nothing will show.
the shoes are in grid view and in each grid the name of the shoe is visible, the price and and the stock available.
There is also a order button in each grid which when tapped the number of shoe in stock reduces as the a shoe has been ordered.
